The Electronic Voting Machine is successfully implemented on
FPGA. While implementing, all the concepts of VLSI has been used.
Now this prototype is thoroughly tested and it is working as per the
specifications. Basys-3 FPGA board and Vivado is used in the
implementation. This Voting Machine is now ready to be used in real
Indian Elections. The advantages of FPGA based Voting Machine
includes: It is a very compact design and easy to transport from one
election center to the other. It works very efficiently and is error- free.
It is very much safe and secure and it is not time- consuming method.
A new concept of Valid Vote is introduced in this Electronic Voting
Machine.
